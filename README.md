### What I learned

It was a great moment to do a recap on my HTML and CSS skills. There are things that I just took for granted and thought I knew them, only to find myself stuck and refering to Google for answers. For example; I wasn't sure of how to clear the gap between the bottom borders in the columns of the table. Another one was the CSS pseudo classes. I loved the challenge more than listening to a tutorial where all answers are provided in case you get stuck. I had to make my hands dirty and juggle my mind in order to come up with a solution. 

### Continued development

There is more for me to learn in CSS in general.
